    Wrapper method for the mtspec subroutine in the library by German A.
    Prieto.

    This method estimates the adaptive weighted multitaper spectrum, as in
    Thomson 1982.  This is done by estimating the DPSS (discrete prolate
    spheroidal sequences), multiplying each of the tapers with the data series,
    take the FFT, and using the adaptive scheme for a better estimation. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : :class:`numpy.ndarray'
        Array with the data.
    nfft : :class:`numpy.ndarray'
        Number of points for fft.
    delta : float
        Sample spacing of the data.
    time_bandwidth : float
        Time-bandwidth product. Common values are 2, 3, 4 and numbers in
        between.
    number_of_tapers : integer, optional
        Number of tapers to use. Defaults to int(2*time_bandwidth) - 1. This is
        maximum senseful amount. More tapers will have no great influence on
        the final spectrum but increase the calculation time. Use fewer tapers
        for a faster calculation.
    quadratic : bool, optional
        Whether or not to caluclate a quadratic multitaper. Defaults to False.
    adaptive : bool, optional
        Whether to use adaptive or constant weighting of the eigenspectra.
        Defaults to True(adaptive).
    verbose : bool, optional
        Passed to the fortran library. Defaults to False.
    optional_output : bool, optional
        Calculates and returns additional output parameters. See the notes in
        the docstring for further details.
    statistics : bool, optional
        Calculates and returns statistics. See the notes in the docstring for
        further details.
    rshape : integer/None, optional
        Determines whether or not to perform the F-test for lines. If rshape is
        1 or 2, then don't put the lines back. If rshape is 2 only check around
        60 Hz. See the fortran source code for more informations. Defaults to
        None (do not perform the F-test).
    fcrit : float/None, optional
       The threshold probability for the F-test. If none is given, the mtspec
       library calculates a default value. See the fortran source code for
       details. Defaults to None.

    Notes
    -----
    This method will at return at least two arrays: The calculated spectrum and
    the corresponding frequencies.
    If optional_output is true it will also return (in the given order)
    (multidimensional) arrays containing the eigenspectra, the corresponding
    eigencoefficients and an array containing the weights for each eigenspectra
    normalized so that the sum of squares over the eigenspectra is one. 
    If statistics is True is will also return (in the given order)
    (multidimensional) arrays containing the jackknife 5% and 95% confidence
    intervals, the F statistics for single line and the number of degrees of
    freedom for each frequency bin.
    If both optional_output and statistics are true, the optional_outputs will
    be returned before the statistics.

    """
    Wrapper method for the sine_psd subroutine in the library by German A.
    Prieto.

    The subroutine is in charge of estimating the adaptive sine multitaper as
    in Riedel and Sidorenko (1995). 
    This is done by performing a MSE adaptive estimation. First a pilot
    spectral estimate is used, and S" is estimated, in order to get te number
    of tapers to use, using (13) of Riedel and Sidorenko for a min square error
    spectrum. 
    Unlike the prolate spheroidal multitapers, the sine multitaper adaptive
    process introduces a variable resolution and error in the frequency domain.
    Complete error information is contained in the output variables as the
    corridor of 1-standard-deviation errors, and in the number of tapers used
    at each frequency.  The errors are estimated in the simplest way, from the
    number of degrees of freedom (two per taper), not by jack-knifing. The
    frequency resolution is found from K*fN/Nf where fN is the Nyquist
    frequency and Nf is the number of frequencies estimated.  The adaptive
    process used is as follows. A quadratic fit to the log PSD within an
    adaptively determined frequency band is used to find an estimate of the
    local second derivative of the spectrum. This is used in an equation like R
    & S (13) for the MSE taper number, with the difference that a parabolic
    weighting is applied with increasing taper order. Because the FFTs of the
    tapered series can be found by resampling the FFT of the original time
    series (doubled in length and padded with zeros) only one FFT is required
    per series, no matter how many tapers are used. This makes the program
    fast. Compared with the Thomson multitaper programs, this code is not only
    fast but simple and short. The spectra associated with the sine tapers are
    weighted before averaging with a parabolically varying weight. The
    expression for the optimal number of tapers given by R & S must be modified
    since it gives an unbounded result near points where S" vanishes, which
    happens at many points in most spectra. This program restricts the rate of
    growth of the number of tapers so that a neighboring covering interval
    estimate is never completely contained in the next such interval.

    This method SHOULD not be used for sharp cutoffs or deep valleys, or small
    sample sizes. Instead use Thomson multitaper in mtspec in this same
    library. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : :class:`numpy.ndarray'
        Array with the data.
    delta : float
        Sample spacing of the data.
    number_of_tapers : integer/None, optional
        Number of tapers to use. If none is given, the library will perform an
        adaptive taper estimation with a varying number of tapers for each
        frequency. Defaults to None.
    number_of_iterations : integer, optional
        Number of iterations to perform. Values less than 2 will be set to 2.
        Defaults to 2.
    degree_of_smoothing : float, optional
        Degree of smoothing. Defaults to 1.0.
    statistics : bool, optional
        Calculates and returns statistics. See the notes in the docstring for
        further details.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Passed to the fortran library. Defaults to False.
